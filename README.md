#Chicago Traffic Camera Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ›‘

The goal of this project is to write a console-based Python program that inputs commands from the
user and outputs data from the Chicago traffic camera database. SQL should be used to retrieve and
compute most of the information, while Python is used to display the results and, if the user chooses,
to plot figures as well.
